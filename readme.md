**Implementation Tips:**  
1. Work sequentially through phases  
2. Allocate 2-3 hours daily for focused work  
3. Use version control for documents (e.g., Git for PRDs)  
4. Maintain a "decisions log" to explain your rationale  
5. Build templates during Phase 1 to reuse in later projects

Each phase builds on the previous one, creating natural checkpoints for review and iteration. Would you like me to provide template examples for any specific deliverable?
